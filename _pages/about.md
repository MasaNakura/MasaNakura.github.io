Hi! I'm Masa, an undergraduate student at the University of Washington studying Computer Science and Mathematics. 

At UW, I have been fortunate enough to be mentored by Professor [Vitaly Ablavsky](https://www.corvidim.net/ablavsky/) at [UWAPL](https://www.apl.uw.edu/) and Professor [Jeffrey Lipton](https://jeffreyianlipton.com/) at the [Transformative Robotics Lab](http://www.transformativeroboticslab.com/). My research experience has ranged from multi-object tracking to computational fabrication. My current research interests lie in the intersections of manufacturing and AI, as well as in Computer Vision. In the past, I have also interned at the [Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/) as a Software Engineer.
