Hi! I'm Masa, an undergraduate student at the University of Washington studying Computer Science and Mathematics. 

At UW, I have been fortunate enough to be mentored by Professor Vitaly Ablavsky at [UWAPL](https://www.apl.uw.edu/) and by Professor Jeffrey Lipton at the [Transformative Robotics Lab](http://www.transformativeroboticslab.com/). My research experience has ranged from multi-object tracking to computational fabrication. In the future, I am mostly excited to research the intersections of munfacturing and AI, as well as Computer Vision. In the past, I have also interned at the [Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/) as a Software Engineer.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
